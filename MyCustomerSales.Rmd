```

Read the dataset; select only the variables relevant for this analysis

```{r}
sales <- read_csv('CustomerSales.csv', col_select = c(ordno, city, orddate, linetotal), col_types = "ccDd")
head(sales)
```

```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(drv = duckdb())
duckdb::duckdb_register(con, "sales", sales)
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT SUM(linetotal) AS total 
FROM sales WHERE CITY='Eindhoven'; 

```


#### What is the total sales in Eindhoven?

#### What is the total sales for each city, for each month, for each year?

### What is the proportional sales contribution (0<= prop <=1) for each city in each year/month combination?

#### What is for each year, for each weekday the number of weeks in which it was the day with the highest sales?
